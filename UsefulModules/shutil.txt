import shutil

shell utilities

used to work with files more directly than os
shutil.copy(filepath, newfilepath) -- can rename the new file copy here
shutil.move(filepath, newfilepath) -- can rename the file in the same line (only way to rename the file)

shutil.copytree -- copies directory

shutil.rmtree -- permanently deletes a directory and all of its contents -- very risky
