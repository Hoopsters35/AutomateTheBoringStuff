import zipfile

used to work with and create zip files

exampleZip = zipfile.ZipFile(path.zip) -- creates a ZipFile object (similar to a file object)

exampleZip.namelist() -- returns a list of directories and files found in the zip file

spamInfo = exampleZip.getinfo('spam.txt') -- pass some file found in the .namelist()
spamInfo.file_size -- variable, not function that is equal to the unzipped size of the file
spamInfo.compress_size -- variable, not function that is equal to the zipped size of the file

exampleZip.close() -- just like files

ZipFile objects contain the entire file, but ZipInfo objects contain much useful information

exampleZip.extractall() -- extracts all elements of the zip file into the current working directory
exampleZip.extractall(directory_path) -- extracts elemenets to given directory -- can create a directory if necessary

exampleZip.extract(file_name, path) -- extracts a single item from the zip file into the given path (cwd by default)

======= create new zip

newZip = zipfile.ZipFile(name.zip, 'w') -- just like a file object (can also use 'a' instead of 'w' to append instead of overwrite)

newZip.write(file_path, compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) -- writes file to the zip file, 2nd arg is the method of compression
